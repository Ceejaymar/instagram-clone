In the config folder, create a file named config.json. Then, copy the contents
of the configDemo.json file, and paste it into the config.json file you created.

Also, change the "username", "database", and "dialect" fields in the config.json
file. Username should be your username for the database, database should be
called "instagram-clone", and dialect should be "postgres".

Change those fields for development, test, and production
